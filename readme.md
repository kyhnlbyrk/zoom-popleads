# Zoom Video Web SDK
Use of this sample app is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/zoom_api_license_and_tou.html)

Please note that Chrome 92 is released on July 20, 2021, and that starting with its release, the SharedArrayBuffer object will only work on websites with proper cross-origin isolation. The Video SDK uses SharedArrayBuffer to optimize media streaming performance, and the SDK will not work properly if you do use it in an environment that is not properly cross-origin isolated.

As an alternative, you may temporarily apply for the `SharedArrayBuffers` [origintrials](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/trials/active) for your domain; this will exempt your domain from the cross-origin isolation requirements, and allow you and your users to use SharedArrayBuffer on your domain until the Chrome 94 release.

## What is Zoom Video Web SDK?

SDKs with the same quality of the Zoom ºs video and audio solutions.

### The Video Web SDK provides the ability to experience the following functionality for your app:
* Launch a video communication session instantly
* Share screen directly from your device
* Send instant chat messages during the session

cd sample-app-videosdk/purejs-demo
